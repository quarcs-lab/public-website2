Invitation to present your research in a webinar organized by the faculty of Nagoya University, Japan

Dear Dr. ,

My name is Carlos Mendez and I am an associate professor of development economics at Nagoya University in Japan. I am also the director of the Quantitative Regional and Computational Lab (QuaRCS-lab)

I read your paper entitled "Spatiotemporal methods for analysis of urban system dynamics: an application to Chile"  and found it very interesting and insightful. Moreover, I believe your research interests could be highly related with those of my research group.

For these reasons, I would like to kindly invite you to present your research findings in a webinar series that we are planning to hold from October to December 2020.  I personally believe that your participation in the QuaRCS-lab webinar series will be a great opportunity to discuss similar research topics, methods, and projects. It can also be useful to enlarge your academic network with scholars from Japan and other countries from Asia, who are actively conducting research about regional development, spatio-temporal methods, and spatial econometrics.

If you are interested, we could have a short conversation via ZOOM where I can explain the logistics, and together we could identify a suitable date and time for your presentation.

Looking forward to your reply.
